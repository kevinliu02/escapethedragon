# escapethedragon

how to run the program visually:

1. download the files
2. open terminal
3. navigate to project folder
4. type: javac findShortestPath.java
5. type: java FindShortestPath dungeon1.txt (I pre-built 7 dungeon maps, so replace the 1 with any number from 2-7 to see the other dungeon maps)
6. watch a screen show up. the program will calculate the shortest path to escape the dungeon map while avoiding the dragon.
